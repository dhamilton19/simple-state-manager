#Simple State Manager for React
See example at: https://github.com/dhamilton91/react-menu-app

This library is intended for learning with small apps.
It does not support arrays in its state as they are bad for passing data around in.

Goals of this project:
* Minimal effort to use (in small apps compared to Redux)
* Fit in between React and Redux on Jared Forysth's Line of "Fed Up" (https://youtu.be/-jwQ3sGoiXg?list=PLb0IAmt7-GS0M8Q95RIc2lOM6nc77q1IY&t=1263)
* One way data flow
* Immutable data
